MATLAB Compiler

* Prerequisites for Deployment 

. Verify the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) is installed and ensure you    
  have installed the right version (the latest might not be appropriate) 

. If the MCR is not installed, run MCRInstaller (that you downloaded on the
  same website than Easyworm) 

. If you have a wrong version of the MCR installed, try installing the right 
  version on top of it.  If necessary remove the wrong version first from your
  computer, then install the right one.

For more information about the MCR and the MCR Installer, see 
“Working With the MCR” in the MATLAB Compiler User’s Guide.    


NOTE: You will need administrator rights to run MCRInstaller. 


* Definitions

For information on deployment terminology, go to 
http://www.mathworks.com/help. Select your product and see 
the Glossary in the User’s Guide.


* NOTE: <matlabroot> is the directory where MATLAB is installed on the target machine.

EASYWORM install guide


Once MCR is installed on your computer, all you have to do is copy the 
Easyworm (1 and 2) executables in the folder of your choice, and run 
them directly (no installation) to start the Easyworm software.
Depending on your computer power it might take up to 2-15sec
to see the interfaces popping up.

EASYWORM  quickstart guide


***IMPORTANT***

Make sure you keep all (executables and image and .mat) files in the same folder



1.  Fit the contour of polymer chains using Easyworm1.exe

***IMPORTANT***

Some height maps (under the form of .txt or image files) have been included 
as examples that can readily be read by the software.  These height maps have been 
regrouped in .zip archived files which names contain the persistence length that 
should be found (at step 2, see next) when analyzing the corresponding height maps.  


* NOTE: Pressing the 'Help' Button in the interface will pop-up a set of instructions
to follow to fit the contour of the polymer chains.



2.  Then load the .mat file (generated in step 1) in Easyworm2

* NOTE: Pressing the 'Help' Button in the interface will pop-up a set of instructions
to follow to analyze the data.
